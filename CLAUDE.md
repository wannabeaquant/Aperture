# Aperture

## What This Is
Low-cost B2B agency lead pipeline for selling AI workflow implementation to international agencies.
Daily automated pipeline: discover agencies → score for AI ROI → generate outreach batch → founder-led LinkedIn/email.
OpenClaw used only for capped enrichment on best leads. Amazon SES for production email.

## Stack
- Python 3.11
- FastAPI + SQLAlchemy
- PostgreSQL (production) / SQLite (dev)
- Redis + Dramatiq (background tasks)
- OpenClaw (optional AI enrichment — off by default)
- Amazon SES (email, production only)
- Twilio WhatsApp (only after explicit compliance checks)
- Brave / Serper / Tavily / Exa / SerpAPI (optional web search fanout)
- Docker Compose (local services)
- alembic (migrations)

## Commands
```powershell
# Prospecting pipeline
python ops\prospecting\discover_agencies.py --dry-run
python ops\prospecting\discover_agencies.py --source seed --seed-file ops\prospecting\agency_seed_urls.example.txt --max-results 50 --min-score 45
$today = Get-Date -Format yyyy-MM-dd
python ops\prospecting\build_agency_pipeline.py --no-search --input-csv "data\prospects\agency_research_queue_$today.csv" --max-sites 30

# With optional OpenClaw enrichment (top leads only)
python ops\prospecting\build_agency_pipeline.py --no-search --input-csv "..." --max-sites 30 --openclaw-top-n 5

# Start services
docker compose up -d
```

## Permanent Facts
- OpenClaw enrichment is OFF by default — only enable for top-scoring leads with --openclaw-top-n
- Generated prospect files go to data/prospects/ (gitignored)
- Never enable Twilio WhatsApp without explicit compliance checks
- Use Amazon SES only in production — not for testing
- All API keys in .env — never hardcode
- Min score threshold: 45 (configurable) before outreach generation
