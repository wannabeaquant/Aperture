# Aperture

Aperture is a low-cost B2B agency lead pipeline for selling practical AI workflow implementation to international agencies.

The first motion is simple:

1. Build a daily list of B2B agencies from seed URLs, optional public search, and optional CSV imports.
2. Score them for likely AI workflow ROI.
3. Generate a manual approval batch for founder-led LinkedIn/email outreach.

## Stack

- FastAPI
- PostgreSQL
- Redis + Dramatiq
- Amazon SES when production email sending is enabled
- Twilio WhatsApp only after explicit compliance checks

## Prospecting Quick Start

Run from the repo root:

```powershell
python ops\prospecting\discover_agencies.py --dry-run
python ops\prospecting\discover_agencies.py --source seed --seed-file ops\prospecting\agency_seed_urls.example.txt --max-results 50 --min-score 45
python ops\prospecting\build_agency_pipeline.py --dry-run
$today = Get-Date -Format yyyy-MM-dd
python ops\prospecting\build_agency_pipeline.py --no-search --input-csv "data\prospects\agency_research_queue_$today.csv" --max-sites 30
```

Generated prospect files are written to ignored `data/prospects/`.

API-backed discovery is optional. Configure Brave, Serper, Tavily, Exa, SerpAPI, or Google Programmable Search keys in `.env` when you want automated web-search fanout.

The operating runbook is in [ops/prospecting/agency-lead-pipeline.md](ops/prospecting/agency-lead-pipeline.md).

## App Setup

1. Copy `ops/.env.example` to `.env`.
2. Update only the provider credentials you actually have.
3. Start the local services with Docker Compose.
4. Start the API and worker processes when using the backend.

Detailed setup is in [docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md).
